Greetings!

The Intro to Bioinformatics course you signed up for starts this Wednesday at 3PM (M3-A805)!

The only thing you need to do before class is install [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/) on the laptop you’ll be working on.  We will need this for the practicum.

I was hoping you would already have access to the the book we’ll be using, but the order has not gone through yet.  I will let you know when access is available.

The first class will be covering:

* Chapters 1 & 2
* Chapter 4 (particularly the final section on tmux)

If you get access to the book before class, we recommend you read Chapters 1 and 2 for a nice big picture overview.

Finally, we’ve set up [a website](http://fredhutchio.github.io/intro-bioinformatics/) for the course, including links to slides and other resources.

See you Wednesday :-)

Chris
