Greetings!

The Intro to Bioinformatics course you signed up for starts this Wednesday at 3PM (M3-A805)!

You will need two things before the first class.

* A Fred Hutch account for server access (for example, fredhutch email, or any other fredhutch computing resources)
* [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/) installed on the laptop you’ll be working on; we will need this for the practicum

You should also now be able to download the book from the publisher:

* Go to <https://members.oreilly.com/account/login>
* Enter the email to which this message has been addressed, and select forgot password (unless you already happen to have an account)
* Set your password via the password reset functionality
* Once logged in, go to <https://members.oreilly.com/account/emedia/index>; you should see the “Bioinformatics Data Skills” there

The first class will be covering Chapters 1 & 2, the final section of Chapter 4, and some of Chapter 3.  If you get access to the book before class, we recommend you read Chapters 1 and 2 for a nice big picture overview.

Finally, we’ve set up [a website](http://fredhutchio.github.io/intro-bioinformatics/) for the course, including links to slides and other resources.  Please come to the class with that website open, as it has a link to the slides we'll be using, which will be helpful to copy and paste commands from.

See you Wednesday :-)

Chris
