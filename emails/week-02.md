Greetings!

Thanks for bearing with us last Wednesday!  We hit some technical turbulence, but that's to be expected through the first round of something like this.  Hopefully, the rest of the course will go much more smoothly as we work out these bugs.  However, as the class progresses, we welcome your feedback about how things are going and what we can do to make them better for you.

If you felt like a lot of the Unix material we covered on Wednesday went by pretty quickly, fear not.  We'll be spending the next two classes going over Unix more methodically, and drawing loosely from chapters 3, 7 and 12.  If you like reading before hand, try getting through 3 and a good chunk of 7 (till around page 148) for this upcoming Wednesday.  If you think you'll get more from the reading after having worked through things in class, that's fine as well.

At the beginning of next class, I'll be opening up the floor for questions.  If there are any questions you have from the previous class, that's a great time to ask them, so the whole class may benefit.  You're also welcome to email either Erick or me directly with questions in the mean time though.


Best

Chris
