Greetings!

Thanks for coming last Wednesday, and thank you for bearing with the technical turbulence as we work out the details.  As the class progresses, we welcome your feedback about how things are going and what we can do to make them better for you.

If you felt like a lot of the Unix material we covered on Wednesday went by pretty quickly, fear not.  We'll be spending the next two classes going over Unix more methodically, and drawing loosely from chapters 3, 7 and 12.  If you like reading before hand, try getting through 3 and a good chunk of 7 (till around page 148) for this upcoming Wednesday.  If you think you'll get more from the reading after having worked through things in class, that's fine as well.

At the beginning of next class, I'll be opening up the floor for questions.  If there are any questions you have from the previous class, that's a great time to ask them, so the whole class may benefit.

You're also welcome to email either Erick or me directly with questions any time. Here are the concepts that we will assume moving forward, so please review them and ask questions as appropriate:

* directories and paths
* commands and flags
* remote access via ssh
* terminal multiplexing

Please make sure that you are up to speed operationally by following these steps:

* connect to lynx/manx using NoMachine (and check [these docs](https://www.nomachine.com/AR11H00579) if copy-paste was giving you trouble)
* connect to the rhino you used before
* re-attach your tmux session with `tmux attach`
* open up a new virtual terminal window
* make a file using `touch <insert your file name here>`
* remove that file using `rm`
* close your terminal window by typing `exit`
* detach your tmux session

Also, if you want more information on tmux and a demo of what it can do, take a look at [the fredhutch.io page on terminal multiplexing](http://www.fredhutch.io/articles/2014/04/27/terminal-multiplex/).


Best
