Greetings!

This email is to inform you that you are currently on the waiting list for the Intro to Bioinformatics course, offered through the Hutch.

If a position in the next upcoming session becomes available, and you're first on the list, we'll contact you about joining us for the session.  Otherwise, your position on the waiting list will reserve a spot for you in an upcoming session.

Please note that this course is offered only to students, faculty and staff of the Hutch.  If you are not so associated with the hutch, we ask that you please let us know so we can release your position.

Please let either Erick or myself know if you have any questions.

Best

Chris
